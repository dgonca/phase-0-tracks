# Git Definitions
By Dominique

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version Control is where you update your project using commits and are able to jump in between versions. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	Branches are an off shoot of the master branch when you want to do a side feature and want to try something new.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is when you save the change to git after making a change in the file. A good commit message is when you accurately describe what the change was.
* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict is when you are editing the same file in different branches and the same line is changed in both brances. when you try to merge the branches back in, a conflict appears.
