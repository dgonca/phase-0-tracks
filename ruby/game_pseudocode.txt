welcome players to the game

ask player 1 for the word
use the word to determine number of guesses by finding the length of the word and inputing that as the number of guesses allowed plus two extra guesses
to give 2 times to mess up. 

say hello to player 2 and tell them the length of the word, and how many guesses they have
ask them for a guess
and lessen by one the number of guesses left

if the letter is in the word, fill it in and then print out the letter in the place where it would be, along with dashes to be a subsitute
for the blank word

if the player guesses a letter that is not in the word, write out "sorry, try again" and then reprint out what letters have already been
correctly guessed

the asking for a letter and seeing if it is in the word or not should happen until either the word has been completley guessed, or if the 
player has ran out of guesses. 

if the player correctly guesses the word, say "congratulations, you guessed the word right"
if the player loses, say "you better get better at guessing if you're going to win."
