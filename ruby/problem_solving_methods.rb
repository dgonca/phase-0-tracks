#release 2: sort an array
#bubble sort

#so the bubble sort method takes an array
#takes the first number in the array at index[0] and finds n-1 (?) which finds the smallest number
#compares the first number and the smallest number and pushes the smallest number to the first, front position
#continues with that first number we were using and compares it to all the other numbers along the string.
#if it's larger than a number its comparing itself to, it will switch positions.
#if not it will just observe the next number along the array

#actually, looking back at the first code i found is that it takes the first integer in the array and compares it with the next one, 
#swapping if needed. does not find the smallest number - some of the visualizations i was looking at were doing that, but the way of 
#finding the smallest number was confusing to me. it is much easier to compare two numbers when you can just iterate through the array by
#adding one to the iterating i 

#i think looking at visualizations of the sorting method help me to understand how the numbers are moving along, and then
#also looking at the code tells me how things are getting compared, so and so - i think working with it more and seeing what each part
#does will be the most helpful

#i think my emotional state is more curiosity than anything. this is something i don't know how to do and i might get frustrated as i am 
#working on it but i think that is definitely a process of learning, at the same time i have to let it not stop me working.
