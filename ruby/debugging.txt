I think that this worflow advice is something that I mean to do with ruby and sometimes I do. It's nice to work on one thing at a time and figure out what is wrong with that. I think I have trouble with some syntax and understanding how ruby works different from javascript, which i know better. Many of my flaws come with type errors and not understanding how strings, integers and floats relate to different pre programmed methods. I also still really need to work on my commit workflow. That would definitely help on working through ruby files and making sure I don't get errors or I work through debugging correctly
