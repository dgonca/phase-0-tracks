so i've done some jquery, mostly just learning through codecademy but I don't remember it.
i will review on codecademy through the assignments i've done and reassociate myself with the material.

i also have a lynda account so i could learn on there, but i have learned pretty well in the past on codecademy so i will probably do that.

if i get stuck on something or have more questions, i now know how to google and find answers on google, i used to get stuck on codecademy a lot when something wasnt working. 

i also should test some jquery in sublime and on my own computer and see how it works without using the internet. i'm not sure how jquery runs - probably like javascript im assuming since i'm pretty sure it is an offshoot of javascript.

using codecademy now after 9 weeks of DBC i will definitely understand more behind how developing languages work and not just follow along with instructions, which i sometimes did before DBC. 

i think breaks are definitely important - its good to let your mind do something else every so often, at least my mind. but i also get distracted somewhat on the internet so i need to be mindful of my breaks.

done learning

I think that the things that I enjoyed the most from learning jquery was how to edit html and use jquery events.
